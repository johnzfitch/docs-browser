Request information from the terminal depending on the value of `n`.

The possible valid values of `n` are described in the paragraphs below. If any other value of `n` is provided, this sequence does nothing.

If `n = 5`, the _operating status_ is requested. The terminal responds to the program with `ESC [ 0 n` to indicate no malfunctions.

If `n = 6`, the _cursor position_ is requested. The terminal responds to the program in the format `ESC [ y ; x R` where `y` is the row and `x` is the column, both one-indexed. If [origin mode (DEC Mode 6)](https://ghostty.org/docs/vt#TODO) is enabled, the reported cursor position is relative to the top-left of the scroll region.

```
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "\033[5n"
```

printf "\033[2;4H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[6n"

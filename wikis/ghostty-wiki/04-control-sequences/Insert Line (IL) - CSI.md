Inserts `n` lines at the current cursor position and shifts existing lines down.

The parameter `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, adjust `n` to be 1. If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to 1.

If the current cursor position is outside of the current scroll region, this sequence does nothing. The cursor is outside of the current scroll region if it is above the [top margin](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind#TODO), below the [bottom margin](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind#TODO), left of the [left margin](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind#TODO), or right of the [right margin](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind#TODO).

This sequence unsets the pending wrap state.

This sequence moves the cursor column to the left margin.

From the current cursor row down `n` lines, insert blank lines colored with a background color according to the current SGR state. When a line is inserted, shift all existing content down one line. The bottommost row is the bottom margin. If content is shifted beyond the bottom margin, it is lost and the existing content beyond the bottom margin is preserved and not shifted.

If a [left margin](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind#TODO) or [right margin](https://ghostty.org/docs/config/keybind#TODO) is set, only the cells within and including the margins are blanked (when inserted) or shifted. Other existing contents to the left of the left margin or right of the right margin remains untouched.

If a multi-cell character would be split, erase the full multi-cell character. For example, if "橋" is printed to the left of the left margin and shifting the line down as a result of IL would split the character, the cell should be erased.

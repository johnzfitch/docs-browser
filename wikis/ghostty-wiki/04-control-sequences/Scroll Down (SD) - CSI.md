This sequence is functionally identical to [Insert Line (IL)](https://ghostty.org/docs/vt/csi/il) with the cursor position set to the top of the scroll region. The cursor position after the operation must be unchanged from when SD was invoked.

This sequence unsets the pending wrap state.

```
printf "\033[1;1H" # move to top-left
printf "\033[0J" # clear screen
printf "ABC\n"
printf "DEF\n"
printf "GHI\n"
printf "\033[3;4r" # scroll region top/bottom
printf "\033[2;2H"
printf "\033[T"
```

```
|ABC_____|
|DEF_____|
|________|
|GHI_____|
```

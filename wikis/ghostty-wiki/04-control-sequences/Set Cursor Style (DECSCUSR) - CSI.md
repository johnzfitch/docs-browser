If `n` is omitted, `n` defaults to `0`. `n` must be an integer between 0 and 6 (inclusive). The mapping of `n` to cursor style is below:

| n | style |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | terminal default |
| 1 | blinking block |
| 2 | steady block |
| 3 | blinking underline |
| 4 | steady underline |
| 5 | blinking vertical bar |
| 6 | steady vertical bar |

For `n = 0`, the terminal default is up to the terminal and is inconsistent across terminal implementations. The default may also be impacted by terminal configuration.
